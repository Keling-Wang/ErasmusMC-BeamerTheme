# Erasmus MC Beamer Template
This is a Beamer template using Erasmus MC colors and logos, adapted from the THU Beamer template. The `ctex` is not used anymore so Chinese characters/captions and font (Kaishu) support are suppressed. `XeLaTeX` is used because there is a pspicture in the template for illustration. `pdfLaTeX` is also applicable if not using this stuff.
